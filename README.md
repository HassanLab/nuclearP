# nuclearP
This project aims to create a comprehensive set of ImageJ macros for nuclear segmentation
and fluorescence intensity measurements in Drosophila eye discs. It uses Deconvolution Lab for
Tikhonov-Mueller deconvolution, WEKA for machine learning-based probability map calculation and
3D ImageJ Suite for final segmentation and 3D object management.

The macros are implemented in Jython and use Java APIs of plugins.
